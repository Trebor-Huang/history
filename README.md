# History of type theory

[![CC BY-NC-SA 4.0][cc-by-nc-sa-shield]][cc-by-nc-sa]

An overview of the history of type theory, mainly for mathematicians. I seek to achive these goals:
- Provide a coherent and up-to-date source of information in Chinese.
- Link to important books and papers I recommend to read.

**You can download the artifacts at [the actions tab](https://github.com/Trebor-Huang/history/actions).**

This is my coursework, abstract due Jan 8, paper due Feb 18. I plan to expand this even more after I submit a version for coursework. Suggestions are welcome! PR's are welcome but they should be after I submit the work, probably.

## TODO

- [X] Introduction
  - Do we need to mention realizability and forcing?
- [ ] Normalization for STLC
- [X] Classical logic
- [X] MLTT
  - [ ] Cite Tom de Jong's stuff?
  - [X] Consistency
  - [X] Applications
  - [ ] Use `fancyvrb` to improve code display?
- [ ] Topos
  - [ ] Elementary topos
  - [ ] Internal language
- [X] Cubical type theory
  - [X] History Part
  - [X] A small basic intro
  - [ ] Cite 1lab properly
- [ ] Misc
  - [ ] Polishing & more history parts
  - [ ] Typesetting, clean up bibliography
  - [ ] Use separate font for metavariables?

## Conventions

As a self-note here are some conventions:
- ASCII punctuation, except for quotes, colons and anything ASCII doesn't have.
- Keep category magic to minimum, so there is a gradient of prerequisites. I can't make this completely self-contained, so there will be stuff that goes unexplained.
- **Never ever** use English jargon, unless discussing the matter of translation. However, use latin names faithfully. On the other hand, it would be asking too much to use Cyrillic or the Arabic script. So I will just note the spelling in the original language, and proceed to use latin transliterations.
